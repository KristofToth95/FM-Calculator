## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference

## Built with

1. ReactJS
2. Responsive Web Design
3. Flexbox
4. Grid

## What I learned

This was my first ever project using ReactJS, so my main goal was to understand the library and get familiar with it. I think I got used to the main principles during development, so the project achieved its goal. On the other hand I'm not too accustomed to building responsive apps yet, so I've increased my knowledge in that area too.
